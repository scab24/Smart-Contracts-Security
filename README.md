# Smart-Contracts-Security

In this repository I will be uploading smart contract vulnerabilities with their detailed explanation using tools such as:
- Foundry
- Echidna
- Slither
- Gas Optimization
- Mantincore
- Huff
- Woke

I will also describe with examples how gas could be optimized when developing smart contracts.

In each type of vulnerabilities are the instructions to run the code.
